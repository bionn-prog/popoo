        <h4>
            Home by seein' you <br>
            Picturing where we'd end up to <br>
            I'm broke and hopeless too  <br>
            Wishin' I could get back to you <br>
            I can't keep goin' on like this <br>
            Well, I don't know, 'cause all I know <br>

            <p></p>i'll be here waiting you to come <br>
            And bring me right back home <br>
            I'm caught up with these memories <br>
            Just by sitting here alone <br>
            If only I could see where it all started, we'll be fine <br>
            It's clear where this is goin' <br>
            I'll keep missing you alone' <br>

            <p></p>Hey, I missed you too <br>
            And just so you know, I still love you <br>
            And I don't even know if I'm alright <br>
            'Cause if I called we'd only end up in a fight <br>
            And I don't wanna keep on getting hurt <br>
            Still holding to your favorite little shirt <br>

            <p></p>I'll be here waiting you to come <br>
            And bring me right back home <br>
            I'm caught up with these memories <br>
            Just by sitting here alone <br>
            If only I could see where it all started, we'll be fine <br>
            It's clear where this is goin' <br>
            I'll keep missing you alone <br>
            If you could see me cryin' in my room <br>

            <p></p>And I don't know where to go <br>
            How can I be fine with being alone? <br>
            I'm just scared of losing you <br>
            I can't  keep seeing you cryin' in your room  <br>
            Yeah, I can't keep seeing you cryin' in your room <br>
            I'll be here waiting you to come <br>
            And bring me right back home <br>
            I'm caught up with these memories <br>
            Just by sitting here alone <br>
            If only I could see where it all started, we'll be fine <br>
            It's clear where this is goin' <br>
            I'll keep missing you alone <br>
            If you could see me cryin' in my room <br>

            <p></p>If you could see me cryin' my room <br>
            If you could see me cryin' my room <br>
            If you could see me cryin' my room <br>
            If you could see me cryin' my room <br>
